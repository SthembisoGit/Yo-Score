# Phase 5: Final Project Deliverance

## 1. Application
YoScore is delivered as a fully integrated three-tier client-server system:
- **User Interface Tier**: React frontend (`frontend/`),
- **Process Logic Tier**: Express backend services, queue-based judge processing, and proctoring service (`backend/`, `ml-service/`),
- **Data Management Tier**: PostgreSQL and Redis persistence.

Application evidence includes:
- authenticated challenge workflows,
- monitored timed sessions,
- automated submission evaluation,
- trust score computation and dashboard reporting,
- admin challenge and audit operations.

## 2. Document on Test Cases and Test Plan
Quality assurance documents:
- `academic-submission/testing/Test-Plan.md`
- `academic-submission/testing/Test-Cases.md`
- `academic-submission/testing/Test-Execution-Evidence.md`

The test set covers:
- authentication and authorization,
- challenge assignment and session control,
- submission/judge lifecycle,
- proctoring and risk logging,
- dashboard and admin reporting integrity.

## 3. Reports
Reports generated by the system are specified in:
- `academic-submission/reports/Report-Specification.md`
- `academic-submission/reports/report-queries.sql`

Report set:
1. User trust summary.
2. Submission performance summary.
3. Proctoring violation analysis.
4. Judge run health report.
5. Work-experience verification/risk report.

## 4. Final Deliverable Must Include
1. Application deployment execution manual:
   - `academic-submission/manuals/Deployment-Execution-Manual.md`
2. Application archive with complete source code.
3. Database backup and DDL script.
4. Test plan, test cases, and execution evidence.
5. Diagram sources and exported figures.
6. Final submission report (single PDF).
