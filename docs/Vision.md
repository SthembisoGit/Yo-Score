# Yo-Score - Vision Document

## 1. Purpose
YoScore is a **Developer Trust and Skill Scoring Platform** designed to objectively evaluate developer skills, problem-solving ability, and trustworthiness in real-world coding scenarios. The platform provides a controlled environment for developers to solve coding challenges while tracking performance and behavior, enabling individuals, teams, and companies to measure and certify developer capabilities.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional coding assessments often fail to accurately reflect real-world developer skills. Developers frequently rely on external references like Stack Overflow or documentation, and current systems do not track behavior, focus, or secure coding practices. This leads to incomplete evaluations, unverifiable trust scores, and hiring or project risks.

## 3. Target Users
- Individual developers seeking to **prove skills and build credibility**.  
- Tech companies and startups looking for **reliable trust scoring** during recruitment.  
- Educational institutions and coding bootcamps evaluating student performance.  

## 4. Key Goals
- Provide **objective, trustworthy developer scoring**.  
- Ensure **secure, monitored environment** for solving challenges.  
- Offer a **reference panel** with curated, allowed documentation.  
- Produce **trust scores** based on challenge results and behavior metrics.  
- Enable **scalable adoption** for individuals, organizations, and enterprises.  

## 5. Success Metrics
- MVP release with all **core modules functional**.  
- Ability to track **developer scores accurately**.  
- User adoption in a small pilot group.  
- Feedback from early users to refine features.  

## 6. Vision Statement
> YoScore aims to become the **industry standard for developer trust and skill assessment**, bridging the gap between knowledge, performance, and verified credibility in software development.
